**Lets talk about Google and AI agents**
I have just watched the video by Google developer talking about their Agent Development Kit (ADK). THe motivation behind it is great, making the agent development super easy, especially multiagent multipurpose ones. Also, agent development feels like software development, additionally it comes with native bidirectional video and audio communications, in simple terms it can hear, see and talk. 

I also like that it is open-source, they have deployed multiple example codes. And remarkably, they built a nice testing ui environment as well, which makes the testing and debugging very easy. The playground UI includes debugging, which means we can see how this model is working, in a way of course. 

They are mentioning it is Model-agnostic, Deployment-agnostic, and Interoperability. Which means, it is not just limited to Gemini, but also ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek or our own model (if we have). We can deploy it anywhere, not just limited ot Google Cloud, any other cloud service or local. Also they have sdk or api i think you cna integrate it to any other apps you have. 

I have just watched the video, i havent tried out ADK yet, it will be another post for some sample projects. Here is the video: https://youtu.be/zgrOwow_uTQ
