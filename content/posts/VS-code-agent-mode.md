All right folks, today we will be talking about AI stuff again. I have watched the new video by VSCode that introduces agent mode. I think VSCode didnt wana loose to other forks with AI stuff, and they added their won. But personally it looks cool, i like how well integrated it is. 

How you can use it? It is easy, just in the little corner of copilot chat, choose the agent mode. You technically can tell to your agent to change specific parts or install or add some code and it will do autonomously.
BUTTTT, you should still know what the hack you are doing for the project. Because you will have to be probabaly using multiple MCP servers. VSCode natively supports MCP servers, you cna just download and run the mcp server you want (probably multiple servers) and connect it, so vscode can talk to all of it. MCP servers and Agents will come with thier own tools and commands, you should learn them for effective usage of it. For example #fetch tool is used whan you would like your ai agent to read or learn from certain websites. 

You can add your own models, like if you have some pro subscriptions. Well, check the video out for better understanding and see the best practices + live demo. I personally liked the video and found super helpful:
